- axionaxtoken.com

### Verify Genesis Hash

```bash
# Check testnet genesis
axionax-cli verify-genesis --chain-id 86137

# Expected output:
# Chain ID: 86137
# Genesis Hash: 0x[official hash from GitHub]
# Status: ✅ VERIFIED

# WARNING if mismatch:
# ⚠️ Genesis mismatch - possible fake network
```

### Verify Network Parameters

```bash
# Get network info
axionax-cli network-info

# Should display:
# Network: axionax Testnet
# Chain ID: 86137
# Version: v1.6.0
# Genesis: 0x[official]
```

## Threat Model

### Trust Assumptions

**Trusted Components:**
- DAO governance process (assumes honest majority)
- Validator set (assumes >66% honest stake)
- VRF implementation (cryptographic security)

**Untrusted Components:**
- Individual workers (can be malicious)
- Individual validators (can vote incorrectly)
- Network participants (can attempt Sybil attacks)
- External data sources

### Attack Vectors & Mitigations

#### 1. Worker Fraud (Submitting Incorrect Outputs)

**Attack**: Worker submits fraudulent compute results to earn rewards without doing work.

**Mitigations**:
- ✅ PoPC statistical sampling (P_detect = 1 - (1-f)^s)
- ✅ Stratified sampling ensures coverage
- ✅ Adaptive escalation for suspicious workers
- ✅ 100% stake slashing on proven fraud
- ✅ Fraud-proof window allows retroactive challenges
- ✅ Replica diversity (β% redundant execution)

**Residual Risk**: Low (if s ≥ 600 and β ≥ 2%)

---

#### 2. Validator Collusion (False-PASS Voting)

**Attack**: Validators collude to pass fraudulent work from co-conspirator workers.

**Mitigations**:
- ✅ Economic penalties: False-PASS slashing (≥500bp)
- ✅ Fraud-proof window allows challenge after sealing
- ✅ Reputation tracking and adaptive escalation
- ✅ Geographic and organizational diversity requirements
- ✅ Public attestations and transparency

**Residual Risk**: Medium (requires ongoing monitoring)

---

#### 3. VRF Grinding (Predicting Challenge Sets)

**Attack**: Worker attempts to manipulate VRF seed to get favorable challenge samples.

**Mitigations**:
- ✅ Delayed VRF (k-block delay, k ≥ 2)
- ✅ Seed derived from future block hashes (unpredictable at commit time)
- ✅ Cryptographic VRF guarantees

**Residual Risk**: Very Low (cryptographically secure)

---

#### 4. DA Withholding (Hiding Outputs)

**Attack**: Worker commits o_root but refuses to provide data for verification.

**Mitigations**:
- ✅ DA pre-commit requirement (erasure coded)
- ✅ Live DA audits by independent auditors
- ✅ Immediate slashing for DA unavailability (50% stake)
- ✅ Time-bound DA windows (Δt_DA)

**Residual Risk**: Low (immediate penalties)

---

#### 5. Sybil Attacks (Fake Identities)

**Attack**: Attacker creates many fake workers/validators to gain influence.

**Mitigations**:
- ✅ Stake requirements (economic barrier)
- ✅ Quota limits per organization/ASN/region
- ✅ Reputation building required for high-value jobs
- ✅ Geographic diversity tracking

**Residual Risk**: Medium (requires ongoing monitoring)

---

#### 6. ASR Gaming (Quota Bypass)

**Attack**: Worker attempts to game ASR scoring to receive disproportionate jobs.

**Mitigations**:
- ✅ Hard quota enforcement (q_max per epoch)
- ✅ FairnessBoost penalty for exceeding quota
- ✅ Organization/ASN aggregation
- ✅ DeAI Sentinel anomaly detection
- ✅ VRF-weighted selection (not just highest score)

**Residual Risk**: Low (multiple enforcement layers)

---

#### 7. Price Manipulation

**Attack**: Colluding parties manipulate PPC to artificially inflate/deflate prices.

**Mitigations**:
- ✅ Protocol-controlled pricing (no bidding)
- ✅ Automatic adjustment based on real metrics (util, queue)
- ✅ Governance-set price bounds (p_min, p_max)
- ✅ Transparent price update logs
- ✅ DeAI monitoring for anomalies

**Residual Risk**: Low (limited manipulation vectors)

---

#### 8. Long-Range Attacks

**Attack**: Attacker rewrites history using old validator keys.

**Mitigations**:
- ✅ Checkpointing mechanism (finality gadget)
- ✅ Weak subjectivity requirements
- ✅ Social consensus on canonical chain

**Residual Risk**: Low (standard PoS mitigations)

---

#### 9. Denial of Service (Network Level)

**Attack**: Flood network with spam transactions or jobs.

**Mitigations**:
- ✅ Gas fees (economic spam deterrent)
- ✅ Rate limiting per address
- ✅ Priority fee market
- ✅ DDoS protection at infrastructure level

**Residual Risk**: Medium (always a concern for public networks)

---

#### 10. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

**Attack**: Exploit bugs in governance, staking, or settlement contracts.

**Mitigations**:
- ✅ External security audits (planned Q1-Q2 2026)
- ✅ Formal verification (critical components)
- ✅ Bug bounty program (TBA)
- ✅ Timelock on governance changes
- ✅ Emergency pause mechanisms

**Residual Risk**: Medium (requires continuous auditing)

## Security Best Practices

### For Validators

1. **Key Management**
   - Use hardware security modules (HSM) for validator keys
   - Never share private keys
   - Implement multi-sig for high-value operations

2. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Keep nodes updated with latest patches
   - Use firewall rules to restrict access
   - Monitor for unusual activity
   - Implement DDoS protection

3. **Operational Security**
   - Diversify validator infrastructure across regions
   - Use monitoring and alerting systems
   - Have incident response plan
   - Participate in fraud detection

### For Workers

1. **Determinism Assurance**
   - Test jobs for deterministic behavior
   - Use pinned dependencies and versions
   - Document execution environment requirements

2. **Data Availability**

   - Monitor DA health metrics
   - Respond quickly to DA challenges

3. **Stake Management**
   - Only stake what you can afford to lose
   - Understand slashing conditions
   - Monitor reputation scores
   - Maintain high uptime

### For Clients (Job Submitters)

1. **Job Specification**
   - Clearly define determinism requirements
   - Set appropriate SLA parameters
   - Use reasonable timeout values

2. **Result Verification**
